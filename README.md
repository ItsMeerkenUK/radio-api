# Radio Station | Streamer Stats Overlay

This is an unofficial Streamer Stats overlay, which can be used by anybody on their streams.  
Just add a **Browser Source** on your trusty streaming software, and paste in the URL below.

```
## Legal Jargon
This system is unofficial, and is not directly endorsed by Global Music Radio, TruckersFM or SimulatorHits.  
You may use this system as you wish to, as the API's are publicly available for anybody to use.  
If you experience any issues whilst using this system, please contact **ItsMeerken** on Discord.  

Again, this system is not endorsed by Global Music Radio, TruckersFM or SimulatorHits, and is privately developed by **Mark Davison**, with the support of **HuckinB** of [SimulatorHits](https://www.simulatorhits.com), who has compiled API information into this system.
